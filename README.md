This app was originally created using Android Studio in 2021. It draws heavy inspiration from Kahoot and is designed to help young people improve their maths skills.

Please note that the project currently only works with an older version of Android Studio, likely from around 2020-2021, although the exact version is currently unknown (as of 01/03/2025).

For now, the app can still be installed directly onto an Android device via the provided .apk file, allowing it to run without needing to rebuild the project.
